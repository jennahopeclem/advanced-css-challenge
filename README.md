# Advanced CSS Challenge

## Homework Assignment #2

In this assignment, I was instructed to build a portfolio demonstrating some of my example projects, an About Me and a contact section. This site has been designed to easily navigate through and see some main components of coding: images, responsiveness, navigation bar and jump links, and more. 

## Usage

In this challenge, I appplied what I've learned using GitHub, HTML and CSS to create a webpage portraying my portfolio. Within my portfolio, users will be able to jump from the navigation bar down to the 3 sections contained inside my website: About me, My projects and Contact me sections.

Users can see each of my sections clearly and even use the scroll in each section's box to read more information.
